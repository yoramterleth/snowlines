### Determines snow cover on glaciers from Landsat imagery. 


This script determines the snow cover extent on glaciers in the GLIMS database the topographic correction relies on the USGS 3DEP DEM, so glaciers outside the US require the users to input different elevation data. 

The method followed is largely based on:

Rastner, P., Prinz, R., Notarnicola, C., Nicholson, L., Sailer, R., Schwaizer, G. and Paul, F., 2019. 
On the automated mapping of snow cover on glaciers and calculation of snow line altitudes from multi-temporal landsat data.
